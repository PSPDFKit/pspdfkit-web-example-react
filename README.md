# PSPDFKit for Web Example ‚Äì React.js

This example shows how to integrate [PSPDFKit for Web](https://pspdfkit.com/web/) into a React app created with Create React App.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- A PSPDFKit for Web license. If you don't already have one
  you can [request a free trial here](https://pspdfkit.com/try/).

## Getting Started

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PSPDFKit/pspdfkit-web-example-react.git
cd pspdfkit-web-example-react
```

Install the project dependencies with `npm`:

```bash
npm install
```

Now that everything is installed we need to configure the app to use our [PSPDFKit for Web license key](https://pspdfkit.com/try/).

Open up the `package.json` file from this repo, find and replace all the occurrences of `YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_GOES_HERE` with the license key that you received via e-mail.

## Running the Example

We are ready to launch the app! üéâ

To run the app in development mode:

```bash
npm run start
```

To create a production build of the app and serve it:

```bash
npm run build
serve -s build
```

Enjoy üçï

## React Component

The React component which implements the PSPDFKit for Web integration can be found at `src/components/pspdfkit/index.js`.

To run this example via Create React App we also had to configure the `baseUrl` that PSPDFKit for Web uses to load its artifacts and base css. Please take a look at `src/App.js`.

In order to make the files above available we had to copy them from the `node_modules/pspdfkit/dist` folder using a script which you can find at `scripts/copy-pspdfkit-files`.
